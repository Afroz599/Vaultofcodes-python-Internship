# 🐾 Virtual Pet Simulator

This mini project is developed as part of the **VaultofCodes QUILD BUILD MODULE Internship Program**.  
The project implements a simple **command-line Virtual Pet Simulator** in Python, demonstrating the use of functions, loops, conditionals, and basic game logic.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to simulate caring for a virtual pet by:
- Feeding it,
- Playing with it,
- Monitoring its happiness and hunger levels,
- Handling automatic changes in pet’s condition as time passes.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Feed your pet** → decreases hunger, slightly decreases happiness.  
- **Play with your pet** → increases happiness, slightly increases hunger.  
- **Check status** → shows current hunger & happiness levels.  
- **Quit the game** → exit anytime with a goodbye message.  
- **Automatic changes** → after every 3 user actions, hunger increases and happiness decreases.  
- **Game Over conditions** → if hunger reaches `100` or happiness reaches `0`, the game ends.
